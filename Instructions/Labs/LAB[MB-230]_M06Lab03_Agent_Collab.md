# Practice Lab - Agent collaboration

## Scenario 

Your organization provides billing and customer support on the Circuit Boards
and other electronic products that it manufactures. With more and more new
agents coming on board, your organization is looking for more ways to help newer
agents solve customer problems faster. One way that they have identified how to
do this is by providing more collaboration options for their agents. Since they
use Microsoft Teams, they have decided to leverage the collaboration
capabilities available between Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365.

Throughout this lab, you will configure the different collaboration features
available. Upon successful completion of the lab, you will have performed the
following:

-   Enabled the Embedded Teams Collaboration features

-   Enabled the Case Swarming Feature

-   Configured the Case Swarming Capabilities.

## Exercise 1: Enable the necessary collaboration features in your environment 

Before your agents can begin collaborating subject matter experts at your
organization, you will need to ensure that you have enabled the necessary
features in your environment.

### Task 1: Enable collaboration features

1.  Open the **Customer Service admin center** application.

2.  Using the navigation on the left, select **Collaboration** under **Agent experience.**

3.  Select **Manage** next to **Embedded chat using Teams**.

4.  Set the following Items to **On**.

    -   Turn on the linking of Dynamics 365 records to Microsoft Teams channels

    -   Turn on Microsoft Teams chats inside Dynamics 365

5.  Select the **Save** button.

6.  Using the navigation on the left, select Collaboration again.

7.  Select **Manage** next to **Customer support swarming**.

8.  On the **Customer support swarming** screen, ensure that Swarming is set to
    **On**.

9.  Under the **Case details** section, select **Activate case form for
    swarming**.

10. From the list of available case forms, locate the **Case form for
    swarming**.

    -   If the status of the form is set to **On**, you can close the browser
        tab to return to the Customer support swarming screen.

    -   If the status of the form is set to **Off,** select the **vertical
        ellipsis** next to the from name, and from the menu that appears, select
        **Turn On**. Once turned on, you can close the browser tab to return to
        the Customer support swarming screen.

### Task 2: Create bookable resource records that can be used as experts.

1.  In the **Customer Service Admin Center** application, use the navigation on
    the left to select **Service scheduling**.

2.  Locate **Resources**, and select **Manage**.

3.  From the **Active Bookable Resources** screen, select the **New Button**
    from the command bar.

4.  Configure the new Bookable resource as follows:

    1.  **Resource Type:** User

    2.  **Contact:** Alan Steiner.

5.  Leave everything else as is and select the **Save and Close** button.

6.  Select the **New** button from the command bar again.

    1.  **Resource Type:** User

    2.  **Contact:** Allie Bellew

8.  Leave everything else as is and select the **Save and Close** button.

## Exercise 2: Configure Case Swarming

Now that we have enabled the necessary features and have defined the resources
that will be used as part of our solution, we are now going to configure the
Case Swarming capabilities in the application. This will consist of two primary
tasks:

-   Defining Skills & assigning those Skills to Experts
