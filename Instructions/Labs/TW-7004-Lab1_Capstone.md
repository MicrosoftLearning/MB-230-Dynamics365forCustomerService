## Scenario 1: Manufacturing

ABC security makes smart security products for both residential and commercial customers. Residential products are sold through retail outlets. Commercial products are typically sold through authorized resellers. Regardless of how a product is sold to a customer, any issues with a product are handled by ABC security directly. 

In addition to direct support, commercial customers can purchase support contracts. These support contracts entitle them to specific response times for a specific number of cases. ABC security provides three tiers of support contract: Diamond, Platinum, and gold. Support agents often need to service multiple customers at the same time and need to be able to ensure that they can easily switch between different customer as needed. 

ABC security provides support to customer across multiple channels such as phone, email, chat, SMS, social and more. Additionally, ABC security wants to provide their customers with a support portal where they can be presented with self-service options as well as open new support cases or interact with customer support agents. Regardless of what support channel is leveraged, all incoming support items are routed to agents based on if the customer has a support agreement and if so, which type of agreement it is.

other customers, but also entitle them to specific response times. There are three levels of support:

when new cases are opened.

product.

    + Once working with the customer, you want to ensure that agents are all following the same 
steps when support customers. (Greeting – Capturing details – working on the issue -

    + You want automate case creation when you can to simplify the process of agent. 
- Two of your companies’ oldest products (Smart Doorbell & Day/Night security camera) have had a 
variety of issues that have occurred with them in the past. For this reason, a large amount of existing knowledge exists on how to resolve these issues.

only internal employees, but customers as a self-service support option.

solutions, open new cases, or engage with agents as needed.
