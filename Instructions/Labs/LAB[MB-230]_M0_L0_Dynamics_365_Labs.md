Module 0: Course introduction
========================

## Practice Lab - Validate lab environment 

Scenario
--------

[OVERALL LAB SCENARIO HERE]


**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.

Exercise 1 - Access the app
---------------------------------------------------

### Task 1 – Create environment

1.  Access <https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com> and log in with your user credentials.

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix (ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, flows, etc. you create.

2. Select **Environments** and click **+New.**

    - For **Name**, enter **[my prefix] Practice.** (Example: mollyc Practice.)
    
    - For **Type**, select **Trial.**
    
    - Change the toggle on **Create a database for this environment?** to **Yes.**
    
    - Leave all other selections as default and click **Save.**
    
    - On the next tab, leave all selections to default and click **Save** again.
    

3. Your **Practice** environment should now show in the list of Environments. You may also see other students' environments in this list with their individual prefixes; only work within your Practice environment.

Exercise 2 – Open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application
---------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application and explore.

### Task 1 – Access the Dynamics 365 application

1.  Go back to <https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com>.

2.  Expand the grid button at the top left of the screen, directly to the left of **Power Platform admin center.** Select **Dynamics 365.**

3.  Select the **Edit** button. You will open the Contoso environment in the **Power Platform Admin center.**

4. From the list of available Dynamics 365 apps, select **[APPLICATION.]**

5. Spend a few minutes exploring the application.
